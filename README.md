# Homework7
 
This is homework 7, homework seven was to create the last three pages of the website. Blog, Special Offer, and Contact.
ToDo: Figure out what's wrong with the footer in the contact section, it is messed up but every other page is strangely fine.
Update: Fixed the footer for the contact page but it's still displaying it wrong even when reuploading to github and cyberduck.
